### What is it?

This project uses YOLO's computer vision model to calculate ball possession by tracking the ball, as well as players on the field.

### Why this project?

I wanted to find a project that aligns with my interests that also involves using computer vision models. This project was originally done by [Abdullah Tarek](https://github.com/abdullahtarek/football_analysis). I have limited my project to simply calculating ball possession. 


## Models Used

- YOLOv5: Object Tracker.
- KMEANS: Distinguish the different teams by jersey colour.
